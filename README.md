 Project Overview
The Cardiac-Access Registry is a pilot project to explore disparities in emergency cardiac care across Texas. Using publicly available EMS data and hospital location information, this project maps EMS response times and transport distances to hospitals capable of performing PCI procedures.  

The goal is to identify areas where patients might experience delayed access to care and to explore how data-driven insights could guide research, hospital planning, and interventions.

 Motivation
I started this project because I’m interested in medicine and medical research, and I wanted to see if data could help understand real-world problems. Quick access to cardiac care is critical for survival, and I hope this registry can help highlight regions that might benefit from additional attention.

 Data Sources
- Public EMS data (response times, call locations)  
- Publicly available hospital locations in Texas (PCI-capable centers)  

*Note:* All data is de-identified and publicly available. No private health information is used.
